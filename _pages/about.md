I am an experienced academic and decision scientist who 
turns data and theory into insights and decisions. I have extensive hands-on experience and expertise in mathematical optimization, statistical modelling, 
and machine learning. I have extensive experience in the design and development of decision support methodologies and tools for the logistics and railway industries. 
I frequently use Python, R, SQL, BigQuery, Excel, and Tableau for data and decision analytics. My main interest is to bring theory to practice to improve and facilitate policy and 
decision making, operational and tactical planning, and business operations automation.
