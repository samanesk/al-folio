I am Saman Eskandarzadeh. I am an experienced academic and decision scientist who 
turns data and theory into insights and decisions. I have extensive hands-on experience and expertise in [mathematical optimization](https://www.gurobi.com/resources/mathematical-optimization-web-page/), and [machine learning](https://www.sas.com/en_au/insights/analytics/machine-learning.html). I have extensive experience in the design and development of decision support methodologies and tools. 
My main research interest is to bring theory to practice to improve and facilitate policy and decision making, operational and tactical planning, and business operations automation. 

I am currently an academic at the university of Sydney, business school.
